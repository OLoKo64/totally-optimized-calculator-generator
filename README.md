# Totally optimized calculator generator

This code generates a meme calculator in Python (Python 3x).
This is obviously a joke, but it's a fun way to learn Rust.

In the `old_code` folder, you can find the original code written in Python, but be prepared to have flashbacks of bad coding practices.

# How to use

1. Run Rust compiler with `cargo run`
2. Done! That's it! You can find the generated calculator in the root of project tree.

You can tweak the code parameters to get a more "capable" calculator, but be careful to not run out of memory.
